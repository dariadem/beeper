Just a small app that plays a sound (or shows you a blinking screen - as you wish) at a selected interval.
Choose the signal type, select 1 of 3 sub-types, enter the time interval and click the 'start' button to start and the 'stop' button - well, to stop.
Or simply click one of the buttons with predefined timing.

It was created in order to play with directly-linked vue.js, and because it's much harder sometimes to find small simple apps (that really fit your needs) than create it.
